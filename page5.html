                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Smart helmet is a type of protective headgear used by the rider which makes bike driving safer than before. The main purpose of this helmet is to provide safety for the rider. This can be implemented by using advanced features like accident indentification, location tracking, use as a hands free device, fall detection. It is compulsory to wear the helmet, without which the ignition switch cannot turn ON. An RF Module can be used as wireless link for communication between transmitter and receiver. If the rider is drunk the ignition gets automatically locked, and sends a message to the registered number with his current location. In case of an accident it will send a message through GSM along with location with the help of GPS module, if the rider falls down from the bike it sends a message to the website which created the safety helmet, then this message is sent to the nearest hospital, so that the hospital can send an ambulance to the accident site, so if the rider is injured he can immediate medical attention. If the helmet is worn then the ignition will start LP otherwise it remains off. For this, Force Sensing Sensor (FSR) sensor is used. The second step is alcohol detection. Alcohol sensor  is  used  as  breath  analyser  which  detects  the presence  of  alcohol  in  rider’s  breath  and  if  it  exceeds permissible limit ignition cannot start. It will send message to the number saying that “Rider is drunk and is trying to ride the bike”. MQ-3 sensor is used for this purpose. When these two conditions are satisfied then only ignition starts. The third main issue is accident and late medical help. If the  rider  has  met  with an accident, he may not receive medical help instantly, which is one of the the main reasons for the death of bike riders. Every  second  people  dies  due  to  delay  in medical help, or in the case where the place of accident is unmanned. In fall detection, we place accelerometer in the bike unit.  By this  mechanism  accidents  can  be  detected. The aim of this project is to make à protection system in a helmet for  the safety of bike rider. The safety helmet that is made is fitted  with  different  sensors responsible for detection. There are two main units in this project. Each unit uses a  microcontroller. Signal  transmission  between the helmet unit and bike unit is done using a RF module. The safety helmet consists :-
<br>Alcohol sensor
<br>MQ-3 gas sensor is used for identifying the alcohol content by breath. It can be positioned just in front of the mouth. The sensor responds to various molecules in alcohol and determines if the rider is drunk. The sensor also has a potentiometer to adjust the concentration of gases. We calibrate the detector for 0.4mg/L of alcohol concentration in air and use a resistance of 200 KΩ. It has a 4 pins namely GND, VCC, A out and D out. The sensor supports both analog and digital outputs. Here we use digital output of this sensor. If the Driver is detected to be drunk a Auto will be sent to his location.
<br>
<br>False Report Feature
<br>To avoid False report and waste Facilities the helmet produces a sound incase it thinks there is an accident which will make the rider alerted about the Report and he can manually turn it off.<br><br>Accelerometer
<br>The accelerometer is a tiny, tri-axial accelerometer with resolution of 13 bit. The output of accelerometer is digital and uses 16 bit 2's complement data.  It  can  be  connected  via Serial  Peripheral  Interface SPI 3-4 wire or I2C interface. Accelerometer is used for both measurement  of  static  and  dynamic  acceleration.  In  this project  we  use  accelerometer,  which  measures  the  static acceleration of gravity. Free-fall sensing unit senses if the bike is falling. And Bike unit take decision that accident is occured or not. Transmitter  modules  are  usually implemented  alongside a microcontroller  which will provide data to  the  module that can be transmitted. RF transmitters are usually subject to  regulatory  requirements  which  dictate  the  maximum allowable transmitter  power output,  harmonics  and  band edge requirements. An  RF  receiver  module  receives  the  modulated  RF signal and demodulates it. There are two modules, such as, super-heterodyne  receiver and super-regenerative receiver. Super-regenerative modules are usually low cost and  low  power  designs  using  a  series  of  amplifiers  to extract  modulated  data  from  a  carrier  wave.  Super-regenerative  modules  are  generally  imprecise  as  their frequency  of  operation  varies  considerably  with temperature and  power supply voltage. Super-heterodyne receivers  have  a  performance  advantage  over  super-regenerative;  i.e.  they  offer  increased  accuracy  and stability over  a large voltage and temperature range. This stability comes  from a  fixed crystal  design  which  in  the past  intended  to  mean  a  comparatively  more  expensive product. However, advances in receiver  chip  design  now mean that currently there is little price difference between super-heterodyne  and  super-regenerative  receiver modules. 
<br>Vibration sensor
<br>Digital vibration sensor is a digital plug and Play sensor block. It has vibration switch, digital input and module and sensor expansion boards with the website in combination. It can sense the weak vibration signals. When the accident occurs It senses the pressure and sends it to the website which in turn sends to the hospital.
<br>Construction
<br>It is already mentioned that the project is divided into two units namely  helmet  and bike. In helmet  unit,  also called the transmitter unit, the force sensing resistor is placed on inside upper part of the helmet where actually head will touch with sensor surface. And alcohol sensor is placed on in front of rider’s mouth so that it can sense easily. Solar panels are mounted on upper side of helmet which is in direct sunlight. And the  battery and regular circuits were fixed inside the helmet.  Secondary controller and RF transmitter circuit were also  placed inside the helmet. Antenna is located outside the helmet.&nbsp;<br></p>
